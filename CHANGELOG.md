# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
The version is owned by `package.json` (starting at `0.0.1`) and bumped on every
push to `main`; `.github/workflows/release.yml` tags and publishes `v<version>`
to match.

**Process (see `CLAUDE.md`):** before every push to `main`, record changes under
`## [Unreleased]` and bump `package.json`'s `version`. For every version, rename
`[Unreleased]` to the bumped version and start a fresh empty `[Unreleased]`. The
release workflow publishes the matching version section (or `[Unreleased]`) as
the GitHub Release body.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.1] - 2026-07-02

First tagged release. A web dashboard that fully drives a bunqueue server over
its public HTTP API plus a small local control agent, with an illustrated
documentation site.

### Added
- **Full control surface.** View and drive queues, jobs, the dead-letter queue,
  cron, webhooks, and workers. Every job action is gated by the job's real
  current state (`src/lib/jobActions.ts`) so the UI never offers something the
  server would reject.
- **Live, not just polled.** Cheap polling plus a Server-Sent-Events stream for
  real-time job activity, with automatic reconnect and rolling throughput,
  latency, and queue-depth charts.
- **Process lifecycle.** A small local control agent (loopback-bound,
  CORS-locked to an allowlist, optional `AGENT_TOKEN`) starts, stops, and
  restarts the bunqueue process with live logs.
- **Read-only SQLite inspector** (`/database`): browse tables, schema and
  indexes, page through rows, and run statement-allowlisted, row-capped,
  read-only queries with `EXPLAIN` and CSV/JSON export.
- **Two API clients by design:** the original `src/lib/api.ts` behind the
  first-generation classic pages, and the complete, shape-verified,
  strict-error-checked `src/lib/bq.ts` behind every Pro control page.
- **Illustrated documentation site** (VitePress, published to GitHub Pages under
  `/docs/`): a user-first, screenshot-backed page per dashboard section, a
  Mermaid data-flow diagram, local search, and auto-generated
  `llms.txt` / `llms-full.txt`.
- **Deployment guides:** Docker (Caddy), Kubernetes, PM2, and hosting-platform
  recipes (Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, GitHub Pages, Render, Fly.io,
  Railway, Google Cloud Run), plus an overview of the two deployment modes.
- **SEO on the docs:** `sitemap.xml`, `robots.txt`, per-page canonical links and
  meta descriptions, and Open Graph / Twitter cards.
- **Docker image** served with Caddy (gzip + zstd, SPA history fallback,
  immutable asset caching), published to the GitHub Container Registry.
- **CI/CD:** the lint + build + test gate on every push and PR, GitHub Pages
  deploy, multi-arch Docker image, and a Release workflow that cross-compiles
  standalone executables for 5 platforms (the all-in-one SPA + `/api` proxy +
  control agent in one binary).
- **Custom brand:** a queue-badge logo and favicon, and hand-drawn monoline
  feature icons on the docs home.
