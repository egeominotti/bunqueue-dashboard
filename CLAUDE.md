# bunqueue-dashboard — project instructions

A web dashboard that **fully drives** a bunqueue server: view + control queues,
jobs, DLQ, cron, webhooks, workers, live activity, and the server **process
lifecycle** (start / stop / restart).

It talks only to bunqueue's public HTTP API (`:6790`) plus a small local
**control agent** that manages the server process. It never imports or modifies
bunqueue source.

## Golden rule: additive only

**Never rewrite or break existing files.** Build new capabilities as **new files**
and connect them with minimal glue (a route in `src/App.tsx`, a nav item in
`src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx`). Two API layers coexist on purpose:

- `src/lib/api.ts` — the original client used by the first-generation view pages.
- `src/lib/bq.ts` — the complete, shape-verified client used by every `pages/control/*`
  page and the agent. **New work uses `bq`.**

Do not "fix" old pages in place; add a corrected new page and route to it.

## Run

```bash
bun install
bun start                   # agent + dashboard together (Ctrl-C stops both) — the simple path
```

`bun start` (scripts/dev.ts) launches the control agent (http://127.0.0.1:6800) and the dashboard
(http://localhost:5273, `/api` proxied to `:6790`). Prefer separate processes? The granular commands
still work:

```bash
bun run agent               # control agent only  → http://127.0.0.1:6800
bun dev                     # dashboard only      → http://localhost:5273
```

The dashboard reads data from a bunqueue server. Start it from **Control ▸ Server** (the agent runs
it) or point the dashboard at an existing server via Settings / `VITE_BUNQUEUE_URL`.

## Gate — all three must be green before considering a change done

```bash
bun run build     # tsc --noEmit + vite build
bun run check     # biome lint + format (production-grade config)
bun test          # unit + agent lifecycle tests
```

CI runs this exact gate on every push and PR (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).

### Biome config

`biome.json` is a **production-grade, root config** (`"root": true`, schema pinned to the installed
CLI). It **must** be root: this is a standalone repository with no parent Biome config, and with
`"root": false` Biome silently falls back to *default* rules on every file (thousands of spurious
errors — that is a broken gate, not real findings). The config enables `recommended` plus a curated
strict set (const/import-type/self-closing/optional-chain/template/no-double-equals/…) as **errors**,
with a few aspirational rules (`useExhaustiveDependencies`, `noUnusedFunctionParameters`, perf/spread)
as **warnings** so they surface without breaking the gate. `agent/` and `scripts/` are excluded
(they are Bun-runtime infra, not part of the app bundle). Keep new `src/` code passing the strict
rules; do not silence a rule to dodge a real fix.

## CI/CD

GitHub Actions under `.github/workflows/` (Bun pinned to the same version as local/Docker):

- **ci.yml** — on push to `main` + every PR: `bun run check`, `bun run build`, `bun test`; uploads
  the `dist/` artifact. This is the merge gate.
- **pages.yml** — on push to `main`: builds with `VITE_BASE` = the Pages sub-path, adds a
  `404.html` SPA fallback, deploys to GitHub Pages. It best-effort auto-enables Pages
  (`configure-pages enablement: true`); if the first run fails with `Get Pages site failed`, enable
  Settings ▸ Pages ▸ Source → GitHub Actions once (GITHUB_TOKEN can't create the site itself).
- **docker.yml** — on push to `main` + tags `v*`: builds the multi-arch image and pushes to
  `ghcr.io/egeominotti/bunqueue-dashboard` (`edge` on main, semver + `latest` on tags).
- **release.yml** — on EVERY push to `main` and on manual tags `v*`: re-runs the gate, zips
  `dist/`, cross-compiles **standalone executables for 5 platforms** (linux x64/arm64, macOS
  x64/arm64, windows x64 — `scripts/serve.ts` via `bun build --compile`: embedded SPA + `/api`
  proxy + control agent in one binary), and publishes a GitHub Release whose body is the
  **`CHANGELOG.md` section for the released version** (auto-generated commit notes appended after).
  The version is owned by **`package.json`** (the single source of truth, starting at `0.0.1`):
  **you MUST bump `package.json`'s `version` on every commit/push to `main`**, and `release.yml`
  tags/publishes `v<version>` to match (if it wasn't bumped, the tag already exists and the publish
  is skipped — never a clobber). Auto-created tags use `GITHUB_TOKEN`, so they don't re-trigger
  docker.yml — semver/`latest` images still come from manually pushed `v*` tags (`edge` tracks every
  main push).

## Changelog rule — MANDATORY on every push / for every version

`CHANGELOG.md` ([Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) format) is the source of the
GitHub Release notes. It is not optional bookkeeping — the release body is extracted from it.

- **Before every push to `main`:** add the changes under `## [Unreleased]`, grouped into
  `### Added` / `### Changed` / `### Fixed` / `### Removed`. Write it for a human reading the
  release, not a commit dump.
- **For every version:** rename `## [Unreleased]` to `## [x.y.z] - YYYY-MM-DD` — where `x.y.z`
  is the **bumped `package.json` version** (the tag `release.yml` will create) and the date is
  today — then start a fresh empty `## [Unreleased]` above it, and add the two reference links at
  the bottom.
- `release.yml`'s "Extract changelog notes" step publishes the section matching the released tag,
  falling back to `[Unreleased]`, then to auto-generated notes if both are empty. So a version that
  ships without its `CHANGELOG.md` section still releases — but with a generic note instead of the
  curated one. Keep the changelog current so every release reads well.

**The lockfile (`bun.lock`) is committed on purpose** — every workflow installs with
`bun install --frozen-lockfile`. Do not re-add it to `.gitignore`.

Deploy note: `vite.config.ts` reads `base` from `VITE_BASE` (default `/`), and `main.tsx` passes
`basename={import.meta.env.BASE_URL}` so the SPA works both at root (dev / Docker) and under the
Pages sub-path.

## Control agent security

The agent can spawn processes, so `agent/server.ts` enforces: **loopback bind (127.0.0.1)**, **CORS
locked to an allowlist** (ACAO never `*`), **403 on any disallowed `Origin`** (blocks drive-by CSRF),
and an **optional `AGENT_TOKEN`** bearer gate on state-changing requests. It is *not* the
"unauthenticated RCE by design" it once was — do not describe it that way. Configure via
`AGENT_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` / `AGENT_TOKEN`. Full threat model in `agent/server.ts`; verified limits in
`docs/known-issues.md`.

## Verified API-shape gotchas (learned from live testing — keep `bq.ts` honest)

- `GET /webhooks`, `/workers`, `/storage`, `/ping` wrap payload in **`{ ok, data: {...} }`**.
- `GET /queues/:q/dlq`, `/dlq/stats`, `/crons`, `/queues/:q/counts` are **flat** (`{ ok, ... }`, no `data`).
- DLQ entries are **`{ job, enteredAt, reason, error, attempts[] }`** — the job is nested, there is no top-level `id`/`name`.
- Jobs have **no `name`** field, **no embedded `result`** (fetch separately via `GET /jobs/:id/result`), and use
  **`startedAt` / `completedAt`** (not `processedOn` / `finishedOn`). `timeline[]` IS persisted (despite an
  in-source comment saying otherwise), capped at 20 entries.
- `PUT /queues/:q/rate-limit` takes **`{ limit }`**; concurrency takes `{ concurrency }` (or `{ limit }`).
- `bq.ts`'s `call()` throws on HTTP-200-with-`{ok:false}` too (many mutating endpoints use this for logical
  failure) — except `health()`, which passes `strict:false` because `/health`'s `ok` is a health flag, not a
  success flag. Follow that pattern for any endpoint where `ok` isn't "did this request succeed".
- Which job actions apply to which job state is centralized in `src/lib/jobActions.ts::actionGates` — use it,
  don't re-derive.
- Full endpoint map, request bodies, and the job-action state table live in `docs/api-mapping.md`. Verified,
  honest list of current dashboard bugs/limitations lives in `docs/known-issues.md` — check it before assuming
  something is a fresh bug.
